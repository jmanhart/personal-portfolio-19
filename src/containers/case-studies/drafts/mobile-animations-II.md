### Overview
As the Sprinklr team grew, it became increasingly important to maintain a consistent style and visual language across all areas of the product. With nearly over a dozen products, it was clear that we needed more systematic ways to guide and leverage our collective efforts.

The initial outcome was to have a collection of reusable components, guided by clear principles, that can be combined together to create as simple and as complex experiences, as needed.

As the Garmin weareable's grow more complex, it became crucial to ensure users have the proper education of the various features for each device. With close to 30 devices we support, it was clear we needed a high fedailty solution that was easy to maintain and simple to scale. Our current animation solution relied on a very delicate process that had many pain points.
